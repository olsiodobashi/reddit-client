## Running the app

To open the app locally, install all dependencies by running `npm install`. After that, start expo by running `npm start`. Expo will give you the following options:

- press W to run on web
- press I to run on iOS simulator
  - make sure you have already opened XCode and the Simulator service (XCode > Open Developer Tools > Simulator)
- press A to run on Android simulator
  - make sure you have Android Studio installed along with all the required SDKs
